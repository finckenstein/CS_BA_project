https://tasty.co/recipe/how-to-roast-a-thanksgiving-turkey,"1) Defrost the turkey. Place the wrapped turkey on a baking sheet and set on the bottom shelf of the fridge. Defrost for 1 day if fresh, or 4 - 5 days, if frozen. For a quicker defrost, submerge the turkey in a large sink or cooler filled with cold water and defrost for 30 minutes per pound of turkey. 2) 1 day before cooking, brine the turkey. Measure the salt into a small bowl. Set up your work station with kitchen shears, a plastic bag, a fresh baking sheet with a wire rack set over it, and a garbage can nearby. 3) Cut(0) the packaging off the defrosted turkey, being careful not to cut the skin or flesh, and remove from the bag. Set the turkey on the baking sheet with the wire rack. Cut off any excess skin around the neck and release the plastic holder securing the legs. Remove any innards and giblets from the cavity and discard. Thoroughly pat the turkey dry with paper towels. 4) Sprinkle the salt all over the turkey, making sure to get in the cavity, under the skin, and between any crevices. 5) Refrigerate the turkey, uncovered, for 1 day. If brining for more than 1 day, cover the turkey with plastic wrap, then remove for the last day to let the skin dry out before roasting. 6) A few hours before serving, prepare the turkey for roasting. Set an oven rack at the lowest height and the other in the middle of the oven. Preheat the oven to 325˚F( 160˚C). 7) Add the butter to a medium bowl. Chop the sage leaves and add to the bowl, along with the garlic, thyme, and rosemary. Mash the herbs into the butter. Set aside. 8) Set a roasting pan or single- use aluminum pan over a baking sheet near your work station. 9) Trim off the wing tips of the turkey and add to the roasting pan. Cut off any excess skin to expose the wishbone, then use a paring knife to cut out the bone. Use your hands or kitchen shears if the bone is hard to remove. Add to the roasting pan. 10) Turn the bird so the legs are facing you. Tug out the plastic holder. Loosen the skin around the breasts, using your fingers to create a pocket. Be careful not to tear the skin. Rub the herb butter under the skin, then all over the rest of the turkey. Make sure to get in any crevices and the cavity. 11) Stuff the lemon wedges and ¼ of the onion inside the turkey cavity. Add the rest of the onion wedges to the roasting pan, along with the carrot and celery. Pour the chicken broth into the pan. 12) Use the wire rack to rest the turkey over the roasting pan, then pour any accumulated juices from the baking sheet into the pan. 13) Set the roasting pan on the lowest oven rack. Place the turkey on the wire rack on the middle oven rack, directly over the roasting pan to catch any juices. 14) Roast the turkey for about 2 hours, or until the internal temperature reaches 160˚F( 71˚C). Start checking the turkey about 90 minutes into roasting to ensure it does not overcook. 15) Remove the turkey from the oven and set the wire rack over a baking sheet to catch any juices. Let rest for about 30 minutes while the internal temperature climbs to 165˚F( 74˚C). 16) Meanwhile, make the gravy: Remove any solids from the roasting pan. Strain(1) the liquid into a large pot and bring to a boil, then let reduce to your desired consistency. The gravy can be served as is or, for a thicker gravy, ladle(2) a few spoonfuls of stock into a small bowl with the flour. Whisk(3) until no lumps remain, then stir(4) a bit of the flour mixture at a time back into the pot. Return to a boil and let cook for 5 minutes, until thickened. Repeat as needed until the gravy has reached your desired consistency. Reduce the heat to low, whisking occasionally, until ready to serve, or remove from the heat and bring back to temperature before serving. 17) Carve the turkey: Transfer the turkey to a large cutting board with a lip to catch any juices. First, release the legs to make carving the rest of the bird easier. Using a sharp knife, cut along where the legs meets the breasts, being careful not to cut all the way through. Then, use your hands to pull the legs and thigh away from the carcass and tuck them under the wings to keep them in place. 18) Cut straight down along both sides of the breast bone until you ca n’t cut any further, then cut horizontally near the wing to release the breasts from the carcass. 19) Cut all the way through the legs to release from the hip joint. 20) Find where the shoulder meets the breast, then cut through that joint to remove the wings, using your hands to pull the wing away if the joint is tough to find. 21) Set the carcass aside-- you can pick off any remaining meat for leftovers, or make stock from the whole carcass. 22) Slice the breasts crosswise, against the grain, then transfer to a serving platter. Cut the drumsticks from the thighs through the joint, wiggling the knife to find an easy release or pulling apart with your hands. Add the drumsticks to the platter. Cut the thigh meat away from the bone, then into bite- size pieces, and add to the platter. Release the flats from the wings by cutting through the joint, pulling apart with your hands if necessary, then add to the platter. 23) Rearrange the meat on the platter so the larger pieces of meat with crispy, browned skin are on top. Garnish the platter with sage leaves and lemon wedges, if desired. 24) Serve with the warm gravy. 25) Enjoy! ","['knife', 'plastic sieve', 'ladle', 'whisk', 'wooden spoon']"

Turn the heat to medium- high heat and cook without stirring until the syrup creates bubbles that are the size of quarters and the temperature reaches 248 ° F( 120 ° C). 6) With the hand mixer running on medium speed, carefully pour the hot sugar syrup into the egg white mixture, resting the pan on the edge of the bowl and aiming the syrup to hit the side of the bowl so it does not splash against the beaters. Whip the mixture until stiff peaks form, about 3 minutes. Add the vanilla and beat on medium- low speed until just combined. Transfer the meringue into a piping bag fitted with a ½-inch( 1.24 cm) round tip. 7) To make the mushroom caps, hold the piping bag upright and squeeze the meringue firmly onto half of the prepared baking sheet into disc shapes ranging from ½ inch( 1.24 cm) to 1½( 3.81 cm) inches in diameter, leaving at least ½ inch( 1.24 cm) of space between each cap. You should use about⅔ of the meringue. Dip your finger in water and smooth the top of each cap. Your fingers will create natural dimples and watermarks to mimic the look of mushrooms caps. 8) To make the mushroom stems, hold the piping bag upright and squeeze the remaining meringue firmly onto the other half of the baking sheet in ½-inch and 1- inch long pieces, leaving at least ½ inch of space between each stem. The number of stems should match the number of caps. 9) Bake the meringue mushrooms for about 3 hours, until the caps and stems feel dry to the touch and are light beige in color. Remove from the oven and let the meringues cool completely. 10) Lightly dust the mushroom caps with the cocoa powder, then use a pastry brush to brush(4) the cocoa powder into the caps until they are a rustic brown color. 11) Spread a bit of melted dark chocolate on the bottom of a mushroom cap, then press the cap onto the top of a stem. Repeat to assemble the remaining mushrooms, then cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate to set completely, about 10 minutes. 12) Make the chocolate bark: Add the heavy cream to a small stainless steel pot and bring to a boil over medium- high heat. 13) Add the chocolate chips to a medium heatproof bowl. Pour the warm cream over the chocolate and stir until melted completely. Let the ganache cool to room temperature, about 1 hour; it should be thick and have the texture of frosting. Once cool, add⅓ of the ganache to a piping bag fitted with a ½-inch round tip and the remaining ganache to a piping bag fitted with a 1- inch round tip. 14) Make the edible moss:   Pulse the pistachios and matcha powder in a food processor until coarsely ground, being careful not to process into a paste. Set aside until ready to decorate. 15) Make the buttercream flowers: Divide the buttercream frosting evenly between 5 medium bowls. Add the violet, pink, yellow, avocado, and mauve food coloring to each bowl and stir until well combined. Transfer each color frosting to a separate piping bag fitted with tips to pipe flowers and leaves. Set aside until ready to decorate. 16) Assemble the cake: Spread the remaining dulce de leche buttercream over the top of the cake. Using the bag with the ½-inch tip, pipe the ganache in a swirl on top of the cake, starting from the center and working toward the outer edge. Use a fork to swirl the ganache and buttercream together to make the top of the tree stump. 17) Using the bag with the 1- inch tip, pipe the remaining ganache onto the sides of the cake and spread to coat completely. Use a fork to draw lines vertically up the sides of the cake for the tree bark. 18) Place mounds of edible moss on top of and around the cake, then place the mushrooms around the moss. 19) Use the colored frostings to pipe leaves and flowers around the cake. 20) Enjoy!

https://tasty.co/recipe/sourdough-starter,"1) Day 1: Add 50 grams whole wheat flour, 50 grams bread flour, and 100 grams warm water to a clear lidded container with a capacity of 1 pint or more. Mix until there are no dry spots. Scrape down the sides of the container with a spatula. Cover with a lid. 2) Use a rubber band or piece of tape to mark the mixture level. This will allow you to track any movement( eventually it will grow!) Set the starter in a warm spot. Let sit for 24 hours. 3) Day 2: After 24 hours, open the container and look for signs of fermentation in the form of bubbles on top, volume growth, and/or a funky, slightly sweet acidic smell. If you see some of these signs, proceed to the next step. If not, cover the starter again and let sit for another 12–24 hours, until these signs appear. If the temperature in your house is cool, it may take a bit longer. 4) Once the starter has gotten a bit bubbly and funky, it is time to discard and feed. Discard all but about 25 grams( 2 tablespoons) of starter( see Note below on how to minimize waste!). Add another 100 grams warm water and stir(0) to dissolve the remaining starter. Add 50 grams of bread flour and 50 grams of whole wheat flour and stir until there are no dry spots. Cover and let sit in a warm spot for another 24 hours. 5) Days 3–15: Repeat the feeding process every day for 7–14 days. Eventually, a few hours after feeding, the starter will begin to grow, almost doubling in size, then deflate again. Once your starter is rising and falling regularly, it is in a good place. 6) To test the readiness of the starter, do a float test: Fill a cup with cool water. Use a clean spoon to take a scoop of the starter( be careful not to stir the starter and deflate the air bubbles that make it float) and carefully plop it in the water. If it floats, it is gassy and alive and ready to make some bread! If not, do n’t despair, it can take a while to get going. Either wait longer if it has only been a few hours since feeding, or if it has been closer to 24 hours since feeding, discard and feed again. 7) After passing the float test, the starter is ready to use for baking! You may find you like to use your starter when it is young, only a few hours after feeding when it just passes the float test. At this point it will smell sweet. If you want a more sour taste, use the starter 6–12 hours after feeding, when it will be more mature and smell a bit more vinegary and funky. This is up to you! 8) Mold: If you see any fuzzy moldy spots on your starter that are black, red, or blue, unless it is very easy to scrape them off the top, unfortunately you need to start over. Sometimes, a while after feeding or being in the refrigerator, the starter will develop a dark, clear liquid on top. This is called hooch and is harmless. Just pour the liquid off! 9) Flour: Use what you have. If you only have all- purpose flour, you can use that. If you only have bread flour, use that. If you only have whole wheat flour, you can use that, just know that you may need to feed more often because it gets funky more quickly. 10) Discard: It may be tempting not to discard most of your starter every time you feed it because you do n’t want to waste, but we discard for a variety of reasons. We are giving the starter a lot of fresh food and water to eat. If we do n’t discard, the starter will retain a lot of that funkiness and also eventually grow to be huge if you just keep adding water and flour to it. I like to discard into another container and keep that container in the refrigerator until I need it for other baking projects. You can fold the discard into banana bread, pancakes, cookies, etc. 11) Storage: Once your starter is up and running, you can either keep it at room temperature and feed it daily, or store it in the refrigerator. To store in the refrigerator, do a regular discard and feed, then place in the refrigerator. A day before you want to begin making bread, pull the starter out and let it come to room temperature. Then, discard and feed as usual. 12) Scaling: This starter recipe calls for equal amounts of water and total flour by weight. You can scale this recipe up or down as needed, depending on how much starter the recipe you are going to make calls for. 13) Enjoy! ",['wooden spoon']
https://tasty.co/recipe/sourdough-bread-for-beginners,"1) Autolyse: Add 400 grams of warm water and the sourdough starter to a medium bowl. Stir(0) with a rubber spatula to dissolve the starter. 2) Add the bread flour and whole wheat flour. Use a spatula or your clean hands to mix until combined and there are no dry spots. Cover with a clean cotton kitchen towel and let sit in a warm place for 60 minutes. 3) Bulk fermentation: After resting the dough, add the salt and remaining 10 grams water. Use your hands to incorporate the salt, squishing the dough through your fingers to make sure it is evenly distributed. 4) Set a bowl of water nearby. Once the salt is incorporated, dip your hand in the water to prevent sticking. Use your wet hand to stretch the dough from the edge of the bowl upwards, then fold toward the center. Repeat a total of 8 times, rotating the bowl slightly after each fold. 5) After the folds, carefully lift the dough up, flip it over, place it back in the bowl and tuck the edges under the dough. Scrape down the edges of the bowl, then cover with the kitchen towel and let rest in a warm place for 60 minutes. 6) Repeat the stretching and folding process 2 more times, waiting 60 minutes after each folding session before beginning again. You should see signs of fermentation in the form of an increase in volume and bubbles along the edges and top of the dough. Wait a little longer, up to 30 more minutes between folds, if you do n’t see those signs yet. 7) Preshape: An hour after the final stretch and fold, dip your hands in the water. Think of the dough as the face of a clock. Slide your hands into the bowl at 3 o’clock and 9 o’clock. Partially lift the dough from the bowl and let it fold under itself. Rotate the bowl and repeat the lifting and fold under 5 - 6 times, until dough has begun to come together in a ball. 8) Carefully lift the dough onto a clean surface. Lightly sprinkle the dough with the dusting flour. Using a bench scraper, or lightly floured hands, carefully rotate and drag the dough towards yourself along the surface, building tension until you have a round, taut ball of dough. Do not make the ball too tight, as it may tear. Lightly flour the dough, cover with the towel, and let rest for 30–40 minutes. 9) Final shape: Dust a proofing basket or a medium bowl lined with a cotton towel lightly with flour. 10) After 40 minutes, the dough should look relaxed and have spread out slightly. Lightly flour the top of the dough again. Using the bench scraper, or a silicone spatula and lightly floured hands, carefully flip the dough over, so the unfloured part is facing upwards. 11) Think of the clock again. Fold in 12 o’clock towards the center, then 6 o’clock, 3 o’clock, and 9 o’clock, then each of the remaining 4 diagonal corners. Carefully transfer the dough, seam- side up, to the prepared proofing basket or bowl. Pinch the seams to ensure they are sealed. Cover the bowl with the towel. 12) Final proof: Transfer the dough to the refrigerator to finish proofing overnight, 12–18 hours. If you want to bake the same day, leave at room temperature for 2–3 hours, then transfer to the refrigerator while you preheat the oven.( Overnight proofing is highly recommended!) 13) When you are ready to bake, preheat the oven to 500 ° F( 260 ° C). Place a Dutch oven or cast iron combo cooker in the oven while it preheats. Make sure your oven has come up to temperature before baking, at least 30 minutes. 14) Prepare a piece of parchment paper about the size of the bottom of your baking vessel. Place the parchment over the proofing basket and gently flip the basket over so the dough drops onto the parchment. 15) Carefully remove the baking vessel from the oven. Use the parchment paper to carefully lift the dough into the pan. Use a sharp paring knife or bread lame to slash(1) the top of the dough a few times. This scoring will allow steam to escape. Cover the vessel with the lid and carefully place in the oven. 16) Bake for 25 minutes, then remove the lid and reduce the oven temperature to 450 ° F( 230 ° C). Continue baking for another 15–20 minutes, until the crust is amber brown. 17) Remove the bread from the oven and carefully transfer to a wire rack. Check to make sure it is done baking by tapping on the bottom-- you should hear a hollow sound. Though it may be tempting to dive right in, let the bread cool completely, at least 2 hours, before slicing with a serrated knife. 18) Store the loaf cut- side down on a cutting board, or in a plastic bag. You can freeze the whole loaf, or pre - slice, then freeze and pull out slices as needed. 19) Notes: If you are using all- purpose flour, use 375 grams of water instead of 400 grams of water for the initial mix. If you do n’t have a Dutch oven or cast iron combo cooker, you could bake in a cast iron skillet, a pizza stone or a sheet pan, uncovered. You could also bake the bread in a greased 9 x 5- inch( 22 x 12 cm) loaf pan( place the bread in the pan seam- side down instead of in a proofing basket.) Bake at 475 ° F( 240 ° C) for 40–45 minutes, until amber brown. Reduce the oven temperature for the last 20 minutes of baking if the bread is getting too dark on top. The bread wo n’t look as shiny and have as crispy of a crust, but will taste just as good! 20) Enjoy! ","['wooden spoon', 'knife']"

https://tasty.co/recipe/whole-wheat-sandwich-bread,"1) In a large bowl, whisk(0) the water, honey, and yeast. Let sit for 5 minutes, until the yeast has bloomed. 2) NOTE: It may be tempting to use all whole wheat flour in this recipe, but, in our testing, that method resulted in dense, tough, squat breads that barely rose when we tried to proof them.   Using some all- purpose flour was necessary to give us the rise and soft, pillowy texture we wanted in a good sandwich bread. 3) Pour in the wheat flour, all- purpose flour, oil, and salt, and mix until the dough comes together in a ball that does not stick to your fingers. 4) NOTE: You can also do the first 2 steps in a standing mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment, mixing on low speed until the dough no longer sticks to the sides. 5) On a lightly floured surface, knead the dough a few times until it really starts to form a tight ball. 6) Form the dough into a ball shape and transfer to a greased bowl, turning the dough to coat it in grease. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a wet towel and store in a warm place for 1 hour. 7) Allow the dough to proof until it has doubled in size. Save the plastic wrap or towel as you ’ll be using it again. 8) Transfer the proofed dough to a lightly floured surface and press the dough– do n’t stretch– into a 7x7- inch( 18x18 cm) square. 9) Fold the top 3rd of the square down, and the bottom 3rd up to form an even rectangle. Pinch the top fold to seal the dough. 10) Roll(1) the dough over so that the seal faces upward and fold both ends up toward the center, so that the dough has formed an even log shape about the size of your loaf pan. 11) Transfer the dough to a greased loaf pan and cover with with the same plastic wrap or towel used before. 12) Let the dough rise for 1 hour, until it has poofed over the edge of the loaf pan about 1½ inches( 4 cm). 13) Preheat the oven to 375 ° F( 190 ° C). 14) Remove the plastic wrap or towel and transfer to the oven and bake for 50 - 55 minutes, until the dough has browned slightly and formed a light brown crust. 15) Immediately remove the loaf from the pan and set aside to cool for at least 1 hour before slicing. 16) Store in an airtight container or bag. The bread can be stored in freezer up to 6 months. 17) Enjoy! ","['whisk', 'rolling pin']"
